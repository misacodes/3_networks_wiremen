# Bank Wiring Room Network

This project is the 3/8 part of my mini-series on social network analysis. The goal of this series is to start with the very basics of network analysis, such as with the concepts of centrality and assortativity, and progress towards more advanced topics, including Erdős-Rényi and Configuration models, as well as Exponential family random graphs. In this third project, I analyze the **Bank Wiring Room** data set, an observational study conducted **in 1939 by F. Roethlisberger and W. Dickson at the Western Electric plant**. This data documented the networks of fourteen employees: two inspectors, three solderers and nine wiremen. For the analysis, I interpreted the roles of each employee type as follows: **inspectors** regulate and manage the plant’s division, **solderers** join or mend metal materials, and **wiremen** maintain electrical equipment. The researchers collected data on the network interactions between these individuals for six different behaviors: **horseplay, arguments over open windows, antagonistic behavior generally, giving help with work tasks, trading work tasks, and friendship**. Additionally, the data was considered in an asymmetric manner, indicating a possible lack of mutuality between two actors. I return to this dataset from 1939 to ask new social network analysis questions, such as whether the network structures for pro-social behaviors (friendship, helping one another) are consistent, and whether they significantly **diverge from the network structures for antagonistic behavior generally. Also, it is interesting to investigate whether the **position and employment level** influence tie formation within pro-social and anti-social networks?
