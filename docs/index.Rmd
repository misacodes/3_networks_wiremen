This project is the 3/8 part of my mini-series on social network analysis. The goal of this series is to start with the very basics of network analysis, such as with the concepts of centrality and assortativity, and progress towards more advanced topics, including Erdős-Rényi and Configuration models, as well as Exponential family random graphs. In this third project, I analyze the **Bank Wiring Room** data set, an observational study conducted **in 1939 by F. Roethlisberger and W. Dickson at the Western Electric plant**. This data documented the networks of fourteen employees: two inspectors, three solderers and nine wiremen. For the analysis, I interpreted the roles of each employee type as follows: **inspectors** regulate and manage the plant’s division, **solderers** join or mend metal materials, and **wiremen** maintain electrical equipment. The researchers collected data on the network interactions between these individuals for six different behaviors: **horseplay, arguments over open windows, antagonistic behavior generally, giving help with work tasks, trading work tasks, and friendship**. Additionally, the data was considered in an asymmetric manner, indicating a possible lack of mutuality between two actors.

The data was originally gathered by Roethlisberger and Dickson in order to measure the “Hawthorne Effect,” or the way in which individuals alter (most typically by improving) their behavior when they know that they are being watched. At the time, the discipline of social network analysis was not nearly as established as it is now, and they did not have the computer power to conduct the kind of analyses that are now possible. For this reason, I return to this dataset from 1939 to ask new social network analysis questions, such as whether the network structures for pro-social behaviors are (horseplay, friendship, helping one another with tasks) consistent, and whether they significantly **diverge from the network structures for anti-social behaviors** (arguments over windows) and antagonistic behavior generally. Also, it is interesting to investigate whether the **position and employment level** influence tie formation within pro-social and anti-social networks?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='\\textwidth', fig.height = 6, fig.align='center'}
# (1) Whether people seem to like one another (undirected, “POS”)
liking <- read.csv("wiring_RDPOS.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
liking_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(liking),mode = "undirected")
plot(liking_g, names=TRUE)
liking_adj <- get.adjacency(liking_g)
liking_adj_matrix <- as.matrix(liking_adj)

# Whether someone helped another (directed, “HLP”)
helping <- read.csv("wiring_RDHLP.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
helping_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(helping),mode = "directed")
plot(helping_g, names=TRUE)
helping_adj <- get.adjacency(helping_g)
helping_adj_matrix <- as.matrix(helping_adj)
helping_both_matrix <- rbind(helping_adj_matrix, t(helping_adj_matrix)) 

# Whether people played games together and horsed around (undirected,“GAM”)
games <- read.csv("wiring_RDGAM.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
games_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(games),mode = "undirected")
plot(games_g, names=TRUE)
games_adj <- get.adjacency(games_g)
games_adj_matrix <- as.matrix(games_adj)

# Whether people had an antagonistic relationship (undirected,“NEG”)
negative <- read.csv("wiring_RDNEG.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
negative_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(negative),mode = "undirected")
plot(negative_g, names=TRUE)
negative_adj <- get.adjacency(negative_g)
negative_A_matrix <- as.matrix(negative_adj)
negative_adj_matrix <- (-1)*negative_A_matrix

# Whether people got in arguments/conflict (undirected, “CON”)
arguments <- read.csv("wiring_RDCON.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
arguments_g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(arguments),mode = "undirected")
plot(arguments_g, names=TRUE)
arguments_adj <- get.adjacency(arguments_g)
arguments_A_matrix <- as.matrix(arguments_adj)
arguments_adj_matrix <- (-1)*arguments_A_matrix
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
